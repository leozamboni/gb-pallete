# GB Tile Generator

Welcome. This tool is designed to generate data used by the gameboy to display graphics to its screen.

This tool allows a user to draw an image, export the data to either C, or Assembly, and import that data into an exsiting gameboy project.

This project will be updated over time, and I hope to eventually include the following features. 

- editing of multiple tiles at once
- saving tile data to local storage 
- multiple canvas sizes
- defining custom palletes (like on a real gameboy)
- Tile Map creation
