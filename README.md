# GB Tile Generator

Welcome. This tool is designed to generate data used by the gameboy to display graphics to its screen.

This tool allows a user to draw an image, export the data to either C, or Assembly, and import that data into an exsiting gameboy project.

This project will be updated over time,  include the following features. 

- Editing of multiple tiles at once
- Saving tile data to local storage 
- Multiple canvas sizes
- Defining custom palletes (like on a real gameboy)
- Tile Map creation
